# UBA-API-ACTIVITY - Movie CRUD API

## Overview

This project is an Express API that manages a movie database. It allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of movies. Each movie has the following properties:
- `id` (auto-generated, number)
- `title` (string, required)
- `director` (string, required)
- `year` (number, required)
- `genre` (string, required)

The API is connected to a MySQL database for data persistence.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   
git clone <repository-link>
cd UBA-API-ACTIVITY

2. Initialize npm and install dependencies:
   
npm init -y
npm install express mysql2 body-parser

3. Create the MySQL database and populate it with sample data:
   
CREATE DATABASE movieDB;
USE movieDB;

CREATE TABLE movies (
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
director VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
year INT NOT NULL,
genre VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO movies (title, director, year, genre)
VALUES ('The Shawshank Redemption', 'Frank Darabont', 1994, 'Drama');

INSERT INTO movies (title, director, year, genre)
VALUES ('The Dark Knight', 'Christopher Nolan', 2008, 'Action');

INSERT INTO movies (title, director, year, genre)
VALUES('Forrest Gump', 'Robert Zemeckis', 1994, 'Drama');

INSERT INTO movies (title, director, year, genre)
VALUES ('Inception', 'Christopher Nolan', 2010, 'Sci-Fi');

INSERT INTO movies (title, director, year, genre)
VALUES('The Matrix', 'The Wachowskis', 1999, 'Sci-Fi');

INSERT INTO movies (title, director, year, genre)
VALUES ('The Godfather', 'Francis Ford Coppola', 1972, 'Crime');

INSERT INTO movies (title, director, year, genre)
VALUES ('Pulp Fiction', 'Quentin Tarantino', 1994, 'Crime');

4. Start the server:
   
node index.js

Your server should now be running on http://localhost:8080.

## Usage with Insomnia

You can test the API using Insomnia by performing the following operations:

- *GET /movies*: Retrieve all movies.
- *GET /movies/{id}*: Retrieve a movie by its ID.
- *POST /movies*: Create a new movie (provide a JSON body with movie data).
- *PUT /movies/{id}*: Update a movie by its ID (provide a JSON body with updated data).
- *DELETE /movies/{id}*: Delete a movie by its ID.

## Error Handling

- *404 Not Found*: If a movie is not found by its ID.
- *400 Bad Request*: If required fields are missing when creating or updating a movie.

## Conclusion

This project provides an easy-to-use API for managing a movie collection with the capability to create, read, update, and delete movies. The API is built with Node.js, Express, and MySQL, and it includes basic validation and error handling.
